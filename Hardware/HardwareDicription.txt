Ultrasonic sensor
	Ultrasonic sensor is a sensor that use the sound wave to meauser the distance until 400 cm 
	
	The ultrasonic has 4 pins:
		1- VCC(VOLTAGE)
		2- GRAUND
		3- Trigger(connected to the digital pin )
		4- Echo (connected to digital pin) 
	
	Trigger pin used to send the ultrasonic sound wave from the transmitter and the echo pin listen for the reflected signal 
	
	Trigger is an output
	Echo is the input of the signal

Encoder  
	Distance 
	What is encoder?
		Electromechanical device that used to provide and electrical signal that is used for speed and position control, which turn the mechanical signal to electric signal that used to control system to monito specific parameters of the application .
		
		Its works by observing the magnetic field change in the magnet in the motor shaft,  there are two output:-
			1- Output A
			2- Output B
		If the motor rotate CW the A signal will generate before B signal 
	
	
	If  the motor rotate CCW B output will be before A output 
	
	
	
	
	Sensor placed in the shaft to provide feedback to the controller, the feedback allow to detect the position and direction of motion,
		There are two type of encoder:-
			1- Absolute: report back the live position of the sensor
			2- Incremental only indicate that has been change in  position and what change was
	
	In robotic mostly used is  incremental type.
	
	Distance formula 
		Starting to calculate the distance per tic
		
	
	
	
	
	Then we will use the di
	stance per tick to calculate the distance traveled:-
	
	
	Speed 
	The encoder are capable to provide speed feedback to the motors, speed can be represent in two main ways: -
		1- Rpm revelation per mint 
		2- m/s
	Titan has an internal RPM count, so no external math is required 
	The math to calculate the velocity of the motor 
	
	
	
	
	
Dc Motor
	A 12DC V motor that has a gear ration of 1:61 with encoder counts per revolution on the output shaft will be 6* 61 = 366 1464.
	
Servo motor 
	Convert the electric energy to mechanical energy, which used control to control the position of the motor using PWM signal 
	PWM
		PWM is pulse with modulation which is an electric way to control the digital signal of the component 
		
		 PWM signal can used for:
			1- Controlling the speed of the motor 
			2- Controlling the position of the micro controller 
		
		
		To control the DC motor 
			 the dc moto is controlled through the Duty cycle of the PWM signal which is the time ration of time a load or circuit is on compared to. The time the load od circuit is off, and the motor will take the average of the duty cycle 
			
			
			Changing the Duty cycle will can create a several virial voltage to control the speed of the motor
			
		To control the position of the servo motor:
			 the width of the pulse  determent the position of the servo 
	
PID CONTRILLER
	  PID control stand for proportional integral derivative which gather to control the output of the system to e close to the required value regardless of the distraction
